Mr.Keks' Sandbox
-----------------

Heyho! I'm happy that you managed to download my game and opened the ReadMe-file!
Not many people do. Whops, did I just say "my game"? Well, I usually prefer calling
it "a toy", as - well - in a game there's usually a certain task.
In this toy, you can do what you want. Just play around with all the stuff.

You can build your own little worlds full of falling sand, boiling water, burning oil
and other stuff like this.

The controls work as follows: Click on a material button to select the material you want to
paint with. You can also change the size and the density of your brush using the sliders.
I suggest you find out what the materials' properities are by trying.

There are also three objects you can place: Blackholes will absorb everything around them
(the radius is determined by the brush size). Spawners create new particles of the last material
you selected before placing the spawner.. Their width is determined by the brush size, whereas
the amount of material created is given by the brush density. Ventilators will move the particles 
horizontally if there's space.
All special objects can be removed by clicking on them with right mouse button.

On the right-hand side of the screen you'll find the buttons Save, Load, Clear all and Close...
Errm, and they do exactly what one would exspect 'em to when you look at their names.
The Save-Button won't ask you for a file name, but just save the current scene to a file with
an incremented number as file name. Feel free to change this name if it doesn't fit you!
By the way: You can also open files, by draging 'em on the sand.exe (=.

So, I think that's it..

Ah, one last thing: You might have noticed that little ad ticker that tells you about stuff I 
like. I don't like advertisement. But nevertheless, I think there are some things people should
know about, 'cos they are really cool/important. Therefore here another listing of the
things advertised:
"First: Other funny stuff by me can be found on www.mrkeks.net!"
"This toy/game has been programmed using BlitzBaisc: www.blitzbasic.com"
"Great fun-punk-ska-music: www.reelbigfish.com 'She has a girlfriend now'"
"BlackSpotSneaker.org - kick mega corporate ass with adbuster's unionmade vegi sneakers!"
"Hug the World! www.FreeHugsCampaign.org"
"Firefox - Rediscover the web! www.mozilla.com"
"Last advice: Eat more cookies!!!"


Well, I hope you enjoy my game. If you do, why don't you drop me a line?
